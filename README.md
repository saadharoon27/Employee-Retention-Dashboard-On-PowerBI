## Project Scope
The goal of this Power BI project is to analyse and identify the reasons for employee attrition within the organization. Employee attrition refers to the process of employees leaving the company voluntarily or involuntarily. By leveraging Power BI's data visualization capabilities, the project aims to provide valuable insights into the factors influencing attrition, enabling informed decision-making and retention strategies

## Data Source
- [HR Analytics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saadharoon27/hr-analytics-dataset/data?select=HR_Analytics.csv)

## Selection Of KPIs
- 1.	**Education Level:** Employees with higher education levels _(Life Sciences and Medical)_ may have different career aspirations, job preferences, and expectations, at the beginning of their career which can influence their decision to leave the company.
- 2.	**Age:** The age bracket with the highest attrition rate is _26-35 years_, or when employees were at the beginning of their careers. As the age increases attrition decreases.
- 3.	**Job Rating:** _Employee ratings_ may give insight into the likeliness of an employee who is going to leave the company in the near future.
- 4.	**Gender:** Which gender has a lower attrition rate.
- 5.	**Salary:** To see if the amount of salary does or does not impact the attrition rate, and in which _salary bracket_ it influences the most.
- 6.	**Job Role:** Which _job roles_ have the highest attrition rates, and are they more demanding jobs.
- 7.	**Company Years:** _Hypothesis:_ The number of years of experience with the company is inversely proportional to the likeliness of the employee leaving the firm.
